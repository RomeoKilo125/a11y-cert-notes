# Usability and Accessibility

- **Explain what "usability" means**
  - Usability is EASY. It's the answer to the question, can I do what I need to? can I do it quickly and efficiently? can my mom figure this out?
- **Explain the overlap and commonalities between usability and accessibility**
  - there's lots of overlap between the two. I think of accessibility as a subset of usability, where the former is typically specific to those with disabilities, usability applies to everyone.
- **Explain the differences between usability and accessibility**
  - But the two can come into conflict sometimes. On occasion, solving an accessibility issue, can create a usability issue, and vice-versa. And often, what a designer might do in the name of usability, is actually counter to both usability *and* accessibility.

## Defining Usability

- ISO definition of usability is the extent to which a product can be used by *specified*users.
- Whitney Quesenbery's 5 E's:
  - *Effective:* can the user accomplish their goal?
  - *Efficient:*can they do it quickly?
  - *Easy to learn* (self explanatory)
  - *Error Tolerant:* it should prevent errors or help the user correct them.

### Difference between "usability" and "user experience"

- A *usable* interface is EASY, to use, to learn, to accomplish goals
- *user experience* encompasses usability but also includes the ideas that:
  - the content of the page should be useful
  - the design is pleasant to use
  - the user feels like they can trust the content (would you trust a janky site?)
  - ACCESSIBILITY

### User centered design

- does what it says on the tin. design should consider the user every step of the way, with testing and research, this includes accessibility testing.

### How are usability and accessibility similar?

Usability and Accessibility overlap more and more, the more you take Accessiblity into account. Accessibility *is* usability specifically for people with disabilities. But the measures we take to make designs accessible, make them more usable for *everyone.*

### differences between usability and accessibility

usability and accessibility are often very similar but sometimes come into conflict. e.g. long image alt text can solve an accessibility issue, but *create a usability* issue. To differentiate between the two, accessiblity issue reports should be specific as to the types of disabilities the issue affects and indicate the specific standards which the issue fails.
