# Universal Design for the Physical World

## Explain the concept of universal design for the physical world

	Universal design is the idea that a single design should be usable by everyone. There needn't be different toilets for different species. Let's build one that everyone can use.

## Name the seven principles of universal design.

1. Equitable Use
	- design should be useful for everyone. If possible it should be usable in the same manner.
2. Flexibility in Use
	- design should provide a variety of options for the use of its features.
3. Simple and Intuitive Use
	- the purpose of the design should be easy to understand. Background, language, experience should not hinder understanding and/or use.
4. Perceptible Information
	- Information about the design should be perceivable to everyone; providing a variety of sensory modalities for receiving the the information.
5. Tolerance for Error
	- The design should reduce chances of accident or unintentional side effects
6. Low Physical Effort
	- The design should require little to no physical effort to use. (implicitly redundant with Equitable?)
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
	- Design should be of sufficient size to allow anyone to use its features.
