# Myths and Misconceptions about Accessibility

There are lots of myths out there, most of which take the form of objections to accessibility. Being able to refute them is essential and necessary to progress.

## Questions

- ?? Cite common myths about and objections to accessibility
  - it's too expensive
  - it's ugly
  - it's too hard
  - we'll check it at the end
- ?? Judge and refute negative myths and objections to accessibility
  - it's cheaper to do it in the beginning, most of it is just design choices and doing things the right way
  - most of it is design choices, or invisible. just because it's accessible doesn't mean it has to be ugly.
  - make right choices, and use the right tools. if it's hard, you're bad at your job.
  - check it at the beginning, middle, and end. you'll have fewer problems.
- ?? Present evidence and examples that debunk myths and support reasons *for* accessibility.
  - ramps integrated with stairs
  - curb cuts for everyone
  - alt text, correct nesting of headings

## Accessibility benefits only a small minority

- People with disabilities aren't a *small* minority, 1 in 5 people has a disability of some kind.

- Anyone can acquire a disability, permanently or temporarily, you can break your arm, have eye surgery, get an ear infection or have a baby who is keeping your hands full, or requires a stroller.

- Yes, when we design and build for accessibility we're thinking specifically of people with disabilities, but the measures we take to ensure accessiblity make designs better for everyone. When talking about the web, accessibility improves cross-browser performance and SEO. Not to mention making things easier for people who are aging or in situations where their abilities are compromised.

## Accessibility is a short-term project

- A11y ain't goin' nowhere. There will *always* be people with disabilites or temporary circumstances that require designs to be accessible.

## Accessibility should be the last step

- Designing for accessibility from the beginning, is easier, cheaper, and yields better results than considering it only at the end.
- added on accessibility measures frequently will create *usability* issues for everyone, and incur ongoing costs
- if you build for accessibility only at the end you effectively have to start all over. You just create 1000 bugs all at once.
- it's always a cycle, good or bad. If you start from the beginning, it's a virtuous cycle that gets even easier over time as you get used to it and build expertise.
- I hate mentioning it, but in the end, you open yourself up to legal liability for non-compliance with ADA, the Equality Act, the UN CRPD, and any number of other national, state and local laws.

## Accessibliity is hard and expensive

- Often times accessibility is as easy as just using the right tools for the right job. Semantic HTML does a LOT of the heavy lifting technically, before that it's down to design choices, and after that there are considerations for dynamic content.
- Yes, it's expensive if you try to retrofit everything into an existing project, but if you take it into account from the beginning, or start building everything *new* with it in mind, and slowly remediate all the old things (along with all the other tech debt you surely have) it's way cheaper. Especially compared with a lawsuit or lost income.

## Accessibility is ugly

- Accessibliity is only ugly if you build it to be ugly, your design doesn't have to look bad to be accessible, be creative ffs. Again, most accessibility is in the design phase, and decisions about implementation. They end up being invisible.
