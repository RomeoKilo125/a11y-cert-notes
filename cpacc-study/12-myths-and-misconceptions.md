## Accessibility benefits only a small minority

- People with disabilities aren't a *small* minority, 1 in 5 people has a disability of some kind.

- Anyone can acquire a disability, permanently or temporarily, you can break your arm, have eye surgery, get an ear infection or have a baby who is keeping your hands full, or requires a stroller.

- Yes, when we design and build for accessibility we're thinking specifically of people with disabilities, but the measures we take to ensure accessiblity make designs better for everyone. When talking about the web, accessibility improves cross-browser performance and SEO. Not to mention making things easier for people who are aging or in situations where their abilities are compromised.

## Accessibility is a short-term project

- A11y ain't goin' nowhere. There will *always* be people with disabilites or temporary circumstances that require designs to be accessible.

## Accessibility should be the last step

- Designing for accessibility from the beginning, is easier, cheaper, and yields better results than considering it only at the end.
- added on accessibility measures frequently will create *usability* issues for everyone, and incur ongoing costs
- if you build for accessibility only at the end you effectively have to start all over. You just create 1000 bugs all at once.

## Accessibliity is hard and expensive

## Accessibility is ugly
