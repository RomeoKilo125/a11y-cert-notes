# Universal Design for the Web

## Identify challenges people with diabilities face while using the web.

- images
- low contrast
- color communicating meaning
- video without captions
- interactive elements that are inaccessible via keyboard
- inconsistent and overly complicated layouts

## Discuss ways in which universal design can be utilized to make web content accessible based on different types of disabilities.

### Basic Layout

- heading layout and hierarchy
- logical tab order
- focus indicator (don't remove the default unless you replace it with something better
- add good alt text
- tables are data tools. not layout tools

### Content

- ensure contrast is adequate
- have captions and/or transcript for all video
- links should clearly state where they go
- label form controls
- Use ARIA effectively:
	- name
	- role
	- state
	- value
	- often this is built into html tags but for dynamic elements, they need to be updated.

### Navigation and dynamic content

- pay attention to dynamic focus when using JavaScript
- everything should be accessible via keyboard
- be consistent with help and navigation

### PDF Documents

- add markup to PDFs (tagged PDF)
- only available through certain authoring tools (Acrobat Pro?)
