# Benefits of Accessible Design

1. Discuss ways in which designing for a11y benefits people with disabilities, society, and businesses.
    - accessibility isn't just for people with permanent disabilities, it is useful in a variety of ways for all people.
    - (e.g. curb cuts help wheelchair users, cyclists, delivery people with handtrucks etc., or voice controls, good for people with motor disabilities, or someone who is cooking and has dirty hands.)
    - accessiblity is good for society at large too, because when people can do things for themselves, they don't need others. that frees up those others to do for *them*selves
    - good for business, because people will take their patronage to places that make it easy to do business.

2. Provide reasoning that justifies accessible design.
    - the only reason you really need: it makes peoples' lives better.
    - improves SEO
    - improves compatibility
    - improves reputation
    - avoids lawsuits
