# Universal Design for Learning

- **What is Universal Design for Learning?**
  - building curricula to be meaningful and workable for as many people as possible.
- **Identify the principles of universal design for learning**
  - Multiple means of representation
  - Multiple means of action and expression
  - multiple means of engagement
- **Describe the purpose of each principle**
  - *representation*: illustrate the lesson in multiple modes to maximize opportunities for understanding
  - *action and expression*: provide multi-modal opportunities for students to show their understanding, visual, written, verbal, physical etc.
  - *engagement*: use multiple methods to recruit and maintain interest. "why are we learning this?", "why is this interesting?"
- **Explain the importance of utilizing principles in curriculum and instructional design**
  - I feel like this is self explanatory, just like all other accessibility issues. It's the right thing to do. UDL attempts to achieve the best possible educational outcomes for as many people as possible.

## Learner Diversity

- there is no OSFA learning or instructional approach
- just like the physical world or the web, multiple options must exist to facilitate learning by as many people as possible.
- Three primary networks responsible for learning:
  - recognition - gathering, understanding, recall
  - strategic - planning, organizing, connecting ideas, execution
  - affective - assignation of meaning and significance to information

## Multiple Means of Representation

Just like with the web and the phyisical world, make sure that students can perceive information in a way that works for them.

presenting information with different media (e.g. written, visual, demonstrative, auditory, tactile) benefits all users, not just those experiencing disabilities

- provide options for perception
  - talk about it
  - show it
  - demonstrate it
  - let them touch it
- provide options for language, mathematical expression, symbols
  - explain symbols, give explanations and definitions for unfamiliar or new terms
  - highlight and emphasize the relationships between structures
- provide options for comprehension
  - draw connections to information the learner already has
  - focus and emphasize critical information
  - progressive guidance (smaller bits to larger bits) to support information processing
  - provide mnemonics and generalizations to support transfer and retention of knowlege

## Multiple Means of Action & Expression

providing various ways for students to demonstrate their learning. (e.g. again written, visual, verbal, artistic)

- provide options for physical action
  - give students opportunities to interact with and manipulate the information
- provide options for expression and communication
- provide options for executive functions

## Multiple Means of Engagement

- get to know your students
- provide options for recruiting interest
- provide options for sustaining effort and persistence
- provide options for self-regulation
