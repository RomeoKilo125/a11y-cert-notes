# Universal Design for Learning

?? Define UD for learning

?? Identify the principles of universal design for learning

?? Describe the purpose of each principle

?? Explain the importance of utilizing principles in curriculum and instructional design

## Learner Diversity

- there is no OSFA learning or instructional approach
- just like the physical world or the web, multiple options must exist to facilitate learning by as many people as possible.
- Three primary networks responsible for learning:
	- recognition - gathering, understanding, recall
	- strategic - planning, organizing, connecting ideas, execution
	- affective - assignation of meaning and significance to information

## Multiple Means of Representation

Just like with the web and the phyisical world, make sure that students can perceive information in a way that works for them.

presenting information with different media (e.g. written, visual, demonstrative, auditory, tactile) benefits all users, not just those experiencing disabilities

- provide options for perception
	- talk about it
	- show it
	- demonstrate it
	- let them touch it
- provide options for language, mathematical expression, symbols
	- explain symbols, give explanations and definitions for unfamiliar or new terms
	- highlight and emphasize the relationships between structures
- provide options for comprehension
	- draw connections to information the learner already has
	- focus and emphasize critical information
	- progressive guidance (smaller bits to larger bits) to support information processing
	- provide mnemonics and generalizations to support transfer and retention of knowlege

## Multiple Means of Action & Expression

providing various ways for students to demonstrate their learning. (e.g. again written, visual, verbal, artistic)

- provide options for physical action
	- give students opportunities to interact with and manipulate the information
- provide options for expression and communication
	- 
- provide options for executive functions

## Multiple Means of Engagement

- get to know your students
- provide options for recruiting interest
- provide options for sustaining effort and persistence
- provide options for self-regulation
